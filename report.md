   - Handles entity recognition, relationships, security, and database needs.

2. **Code Generation**:
   - Supports FastAPI and Django REST frameworks.
   - Generates project files: Models, API endpoints, authentication, and documentation.
   - Includes production-ready configurations.

3. **Customization & Extensibility**:
   - Extends framework support and NLP capabilities.
   - Provides hooks for custom templates and business logic.

4. **Deployment-Ready**:
   - Docker files and environment settings for production.

5. **Testing Framework**:
   - Comprehensive test suite generation.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Beginner-friendly and in-depth guides for usage.
